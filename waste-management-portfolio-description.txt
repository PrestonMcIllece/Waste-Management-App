Portfolio Description

Our Waste Management application that my group in CMPT 307 built has been chosen to include
in my portfolio because it was a project that really forced myself, as well as my entire group
to develop creative and effective problem solving skills. This application was built for the 
Environment Center of Westminster College so that they could better keep track of their waste 
data. The application consisted of a Java/Swing front end and an sqlite backend. This project was
the first time that I had built a project with a database as well as my first time building an
application of this size. Additionally, I was unfamiliar with the Swing framework as well as 
sqlite before the project which is why my problem solving skills developed so much from this
project. Lastly, I've chosen to include this project in my portfolio because I'm very proud
of how the application turned out. Our group worked very well together and I think that shows
in the final product.
